Have a need for Bootstrap's brand resources? Great! We have only a few guidelines we follow, and in turn ask you to follow as well. These guidelines were inspired by MailChimp's [Brand Assets](https://mailchimp.com/about/brand-assets/).

## Mark and logo

Use either the Bootstrap mark (a capital **B**) or the standard logo (just **Bootstrap**). It should always appear in San Francisco Display Semibold. **Do not use the Twitter bird** in association with Bootstrap.

## Download mark

Download the Bootstrap mark in one of three styles, each available as an SVG file. Right click, Save as.

## Name

The project and framework should always be referred to as **Bootstrap**. No Twitter before it, no capital _s_, and no abbreviations except for one, a capital **B**.

## Colors

Our docs and branding use a handful of primary colors to differentiate what _is_ Bootstrap from what _is in_ Bootstrap. In other words, if it's purple, it's representative of Bootstrap.
